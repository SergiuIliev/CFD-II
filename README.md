The objective of [the study associated](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317276994_Riemann_shock_tube_compressible_flow_analysis_using_a_two-step_Lax-Friedrichs_scheme_-_Computational_Fluid_Dynamics_Coursework_II) with this repository is to present a computational fluid dynamics solution to the one-dimensional Euler equations of compressible flow by using a two-step Lax-Friedrichs scheme.

Riemann shock tube compressible flow analysis is performed using a two-step Lax-Friedrichs scheme. The structure has five parts, progressing from discretization and analysis to stability and performance evaluation.

Additional details are in the [associated paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317276994_Riemann_shock_tube_compressible_flow_analysis_using_a_two-step_Lax-Friedrichs_scheme_-_Computational_Fluid_Dynamics_Coursework_II). Additionally, as an introduction to the topic, I have also modelled the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation in [this repository](https://github.com/SergiuIliev/CFD-I).
